      <p>Ruby Archer is a Melbourne-based artist known for evocative landscape paintings and vibrant abstracts. She works in oils and mixed media, exploring themes of memory and nature. Ruby’s work has been featured in galleries across Australia and internationally. In her practice, she often starts with plein-air sketches and develops them into larger studio pieces. Her paintings aim to capture both the physical beauty of a scene and the emotional tone it evokes.</p>
